# Final definition

A unit test is an automated piece of code that invokes the unit of work through an entry point,
and then checks one of its exit points. A unit is almost always written using a unit testing framework.
It can be written easily and runs quickly. It's trustworthy, readable & maintainable. 
It is consistent as long as the production code we control has not been changed.
